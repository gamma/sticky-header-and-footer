Sticky Header and Footer
============

This is a sleek and fast jQuery and lesscss based implementation for a sticky header and/or footer. The will either be completely visible or slide in when hovering the hint. It is build with dynamic header and footer heights in mind, so they are not a problem.

Despite calculating the positions on its own it relies on the browser to do the heavy lifting and only toggles the current state. Resizing is not a problem: the header and footer will adapt.

The implementation is based up on [Sticky Footer by Ryan Fait](http://ryanfait.com/)
